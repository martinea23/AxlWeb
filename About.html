<!-- 
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Portland,
                        where I honed my skills and developed a deep appreciation for the world of technology.
                        I find joy in coding and bringing my own projects to life,
                        constantly seeking new ways to innovate and make a positive impact through software development.
                        When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you can often find me on a soccer field,
                        enjoying the beautiful game and the camaraderie it brings.
                        I'm also an avid traveler, always eager to explore new places and cultures,
                        which fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective.
                        Whether it's crafting lines of code or exploring far-off destinations,
                        I'm dedicated to embracing the journey of life with enthusiasm and a thirst for knowledge. -->
